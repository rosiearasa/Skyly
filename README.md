## Goals

Use an API to create an application to consolidate my learning in iOS mobile development




## What I built

A dark mode enabled weather app that uses the weatherAPI to respond to queries on weather data
The app is location enabled using GPS data from the device or you can set up the location manually 

## What I learnt

Apply Delegate Design Pattern
Appy best practices in swift: Protocols, Extensions, Using Data Structs, Swift Guard, Closures and Completion Handlers etc
Networking using URLSession and making Https requests
Parsing JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
Using Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
Using Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS. 

## What Next...
I will continue to build out the application and update on new features soon
